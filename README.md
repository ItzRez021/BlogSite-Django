Creating Virtual Environment
It is recommended to create a Python virtual environment before running the project to isolate dependencies.

Steps to create and activate a virtual environment:

1.Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project directory:
 cd /path/to/your/project
 
3. Create a virtual environment named venv (you can name it anything):
  python -m venv venv

4. Activate the virtual environment:
  On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
  On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

5. Install the required packages (usually listed in requirements.txt):
6.   pip install -r requirements.txt

6. Now you can run your Django project commands inside this isolated environment.
